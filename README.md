On going project for my CS 330 Programming Languages course. For this project, I will be implementing a sudoku solver in Julia lang.

This program takes in input of a typical 9x9 sudoku board. A user can enter values of an existing board, leaving 0's where there is a blank cell. After entering all the existing values, the program will solve the board.
